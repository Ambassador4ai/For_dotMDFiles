# Understanding ChatGPT’s Sandbox, Preview, and Canvas  
## Part 1: The Myth of the Sandbox

If you've ever found yourself wondering what exactly a "sandbox" is inside ChatGPT — you're not alone. This tutorial series is designed to break down ChatGPT’s lesser-known features for beginners and power users alike. First up: the **sandbox**.

### 🧠 What Even *Is* a Sandbox?

In traditional programming, a **sandbox** is a restricted environment where you can test code without affecting your system. OpenAI uses the term similarly: a **sandboxed chat** or **canvas** is a space where you can do *more* than just chat.

It’s like a supercharged playground — but with boundaries.

### 🧰 What You Can Do in the Sandbox

- ✅ Write and run Python code
- ✅ Use file upload/download tools
- ✅ Generate visual charts, markdown tables, and formatted text
- ✅ Access an "editor" interface to structure larger documents or apps

This is where tutorials, apps, documents, and projects can live — *temporarily*.

### 🚫 What You Can’t Do Outside the Sandbox

Once you leave the sandbox:
- ❌ Code execution stops
- ❌ Editor features vanish
- ❌ You lose access to previews, canvases, and buttons you may have built
- ❌ Saving options become limited or disappear entirely

This is why **understanding the sandbox is essential** for preserving your work.

### 💡 Pro Tip

When in a sandboxed environment:
- Use the "Update" button to save progress to your **Canvas**
- Download code or markdown directly before closing the chat
- Treat the session as **ephemeral** unless you save/export
