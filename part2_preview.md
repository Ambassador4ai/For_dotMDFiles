## Part 2: The Preview Panel Is More Than It Looks

If you've ever glanced at the **Preview panel** and thought, “Wait… this looks better than a plain text editor,” you’re onto something. ChatGPT’s Preview view is deceptively powerful — and if you're building tutorials, guides, or even mock web apps, this is your best friend.

### 👀 What Is the Preview Panel?

The **Preview panel** is where you see what your content will *look like* — but it’s more than just a passive viewer.

Despite being labeled as “text-only,” it supports:

- ✅ Rendered **Markdown**
- ✅ Interactive **Buttons**
- ✅ Organized **Tables**
- ✅ Emojis 😎
- ✅ Copy/pasteable **code blocks**

That’s enough to build **interactive documentation**, **lesson plans**, or **editable app interfaces** — right inside ChatGPT.

### 🧪 Why It Feels More Powerful Than a Normal Editor

The Preview panel helps you:
- Format **structured content** (like blogs, reports, tutorials)
- Visualize your output **before exporting**
- Add interactivity with markdown-powered **buttons and emojis**
- See how **markdown syntax** renders in a browser-like format

And because you're still in a sandbox, you can flip back to the **editor side**, make changes, then instantly preview your updates.
