Part 5: Getting Out of the Sandbox — Exporting and Extending Your Work


# Understanding ChatGPT’s Sandbox, Preview, and Canvas  
## Part 5: Getting Out of the Sandbox — Exporting and Extending Your Work

You’ve built something useful — a lesson plan, a code script, maybe even a mini app — inside ChatGPT’s sandbox. But now comes the real question:

**How do you get it out?**

In this final part of our series, we’ll walk through the key methods for preserving and using your creations outside of ChatGPT.

### 🚪 Why You Need to Leave the Sandbox

Inside the sandbox:
- You can build and run code  
- Render beautiful markdown  
- Preview structured content  

But:  
- You can’t permanently store content unless you save or export it  
- You can’t run that same code later unless you re-import it  
- Markdown or buttons won’t render in plain chat  

So: **get your work out before you lose it.**

### 🧰 Ways to Export Your Work

#### 1. **Export Markdown**
- From the preview/editor, copy and paste
- Or click the **Download (.md)** option
- Open in any markdown viewer or website builder

#### 2. **Export Python or Other Code**
- Use the **Download (.py)** button
- Paste into VS Code, Replit, or your terminal

#### 3. **Save to Canvas (Short-Term Storage)**
- Click “Update” then save in the left sidebar
- Great for coming back later *in the same sandbox context*

#### 4. **Copy to Clipboard**
- Fastest way to move formatted content
- Paste into Notion, Google Docs, Obsidian, or your blog

### 🔗 Extend With External Tools

Want to go further?

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **VS Code** | Edit, run, and debug your code |
| **Notion / Obsidian** | Embed markdown notes and visuals |
| **GitHub** | Share your work with collaborators |
| **Framer / Webflow** | Use your markdown to prototype UI/UX |
| **Python + File Storage** | Persist and serve generated content |
| **ChatGPT API** | Automate generation outside the web app |

### 🧠 Pro Tip: Automate It

For repeatable workflows:
- Build templates inside ChatGPT  
- Save prompts + outputs in reusable snippets  
- Use scripting (e.g., Python) to move files automatically
