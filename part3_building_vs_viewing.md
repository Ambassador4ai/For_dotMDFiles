## Part 3: Building vs Viewing — What Happens Where in ChatGPT

Once you start using ChatGPT’s sandbox and canvas features, you’ll run into two important spaces: **Editor Mode** and **Preview Mode**. These aren’t just aesthetic differences — they fundamentally shape *how* and *what* you create.

Let’s break it down 👇

---

### 🛠️ Editor Mode = Building

This is where your **content is authored**:
- ✍️ Type text, code, or markdown
- 🧱 Use slash commands (`/table`, `/code`, etc.)
- 🪄 Get assistance from ChatGPT in real-time

Editor Mode is your **construction zone** — complete with power tools (code suggestions, formatting commands) and collaboration features.

---

### 👀 Preview Mode = Viewing

This is where your **work is rendered**:
- ✅ You see final formatting
- ✅ Markdown is parsed into readable HTML
- ✅ Buttons, tables, and emojis display as intended
- ✅ Code blocks look clean, copyable, and sharable

Think of this like a **live demo** — perfect for sharing, screenshots, and polishing.

### 💡 Workflow Tip

**Treat Editor like your staging area, and Preview like your production site.**  
Flip back and forth often. Use Preview to check how your tutorial, document, or app *looks* — but return to Editor to make changes.
